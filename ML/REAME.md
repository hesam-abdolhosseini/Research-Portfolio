# Machine learning portfolio (IBM ML0101EN aligned)

This folder collects small, reproducible projects following the IBM "Machine Learning with Python" course outline. The goal is clarity, reproducibility, and bilingual documentation.

- Modules added step-by-step in syllabus order.
- Each module has a minimal README, datasets (if any), and concise notebooks/scripts.

## Roadmap

1. Introduction to Machine Learning (examples, libraries, supervised vs. unsupervised)
2. Regression (linear, non-linear)
3. Classification (KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM)
4. Clustering (k-means, Hierarchical, Density-based)
5. Recommender Systems (content-based)
6. Final assignment

## Reproducibility

- Python version: 3.10+
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r env/requirements.txt
