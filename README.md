# Research-Portfolio

Research portfolio highlighting optimization, embedded ML, and secure systems. Focused on reproducibility, efficiency, and practical prototypes for resource-constrained environments.

## Structure
- optimization/: Multi-objective and system-level trade-offs (latency, reliability, buffers)
- embedded-ml/: Quantization, fixed-point preprocessing, and edge deployment stubs
- secure-systems/: Lightweight secure messaging and integrity under constraints
- sensor-fusion/: IMU/sEMG conceptual fusion and adaptive execution demos
- teaching-refs/: Bilingual, reproducible materials linked to course labs
- docs/: Figures, portfolio overview, and shared diagrams
- scripts/: Repo-wide benchmark and build helpers
- tests/: Minimal sanity checks across modules

## Quick links

## Notes
Each module will include: README with objective/method/results, small data samples, one-command reproducibility scripts, and minimal tests.
